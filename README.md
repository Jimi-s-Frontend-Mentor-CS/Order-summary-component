## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned more about the ```place-items``` and ```place-content``` properties.

### Continued development

For this challenge I barely need help, meaning that over time I'm learning and understanding more of what I do and how I can do it.

I still need to learn more about flexbox in general and the mobile-first workflow
